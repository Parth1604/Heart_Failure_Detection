# Heart_Failure_Detection

**Objective:** Predict the likelihood of heart failure using various features related to a patient's health.

# Project Structure:
+ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** A comprehensive analysis of the dataset to gain insights, understand data distribution, and identify key patterns.
+ **Detecting and Handling Outliers:** A dedicated section to identify outliers that could skew predictions and address them to enhance the accuracy of the predictive models.
+ **Designing Algorithms:** Implementation and evaluation of various algorithms to identify the best performing model for predicting heart failure.
