# Heart_Failure_Detection

**Objective:** Predict the likelihood of heart failure using various features related to a patient's health.

**Dataset :** 

Of course! Here are brief descriptions for each of the dataset variables:

Age: Represents the age of the individual.

Sex: Indicates the gender of the individual, typically denoted as male or female.

ChestPainType: Describes the type or nature of chest pain experienced by the individual. This could refer to specific medical classifications of chest pain.

RestingBP: Represents the resting blood pressure of the individual, typically measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). It refers to the blood pressure when the individual is at rest.

Cholesterol: Indicates the cholesterol level in the individual's blood, usually measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL).

FastingBS: Stands for fasting blood sugar. It indicates whether the individual's fasting blood sugar level is above a certain threshold, typically used to assess the risk or presence of diabetes.

RestingECG: Represents the results of an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) test when the individual is at rest. It's a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart.

MaxHR: Denotes the maximum heart rate achieved by the individual, typically during a stress test or physical exercise.

ExerciseAngina: Indicates whether the individual experienced angina (chest pain) during exercise or physical activity.

Oldpeak: Refers to the depression (or difference) of the ST segment in an ECG, which can be indicative of heart conditions when compared to the segment at rest.

ST_Slope: Describes the slope of the ST segment in an ECG. The ST segment slope can be indicative of specific heart conditions. There are typically three types: upsloping, flat, and downsloping.

HeartDisea: Likely a binary variable indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease in the individual.



# Project Structure:
+ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** A comprehensive analysis of the dataset to gain insights, understand data distribution, and identify key patterns.
+ **Detecting and Handling Outliers:** A dedicated section to identify outliers that could skew predictions and address them to enhance the accuracy of the predictive models.
+ **Designing Algorithms:** Implementation and evaluation of various algorithms to identify the best performing model for predicting heart failure.
